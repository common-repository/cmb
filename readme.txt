Here is a short description of the plugin.  This should be no more than 150 chars.  No markup here.

== Description ==

Colour Me Bad is a  little app in Action Script that takes information from your recent played tracks in Last FM , picks up the top tags for that music and cross searches that with Kuler’s tags, resulting in a graphic representation of your music and , some would argue, your mood.
I am planning to develop this into all kind of other directions, anyone out there who is feeling the direction i am going with this and would like to collaborate please hit me on the contact page and hopefully we can get rich and creative.

we are also using this;
